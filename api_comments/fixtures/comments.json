ActiveRecord is so powerful, and Ruby is so expressive and fun to write in. I used to start projects with RoR and try to incorporate React with APIs or GraphQL, but would get tired of the context change. With Inertia, React is just the view layer in the monolith, it doesn't feel separate at all. I love working in this stack and will probably start all future projects heavier than a brochure page with it. If anybody uses React or Laravel, do yourself a favor and check out Inertia, it brings the whole stack together.",
